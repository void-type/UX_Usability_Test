						<h3>Description</h3>
						<hr/>
						<h3>CPU</h3>
						<p>At this budget, we're running an Intel i5-6500. Any modern i5 will perform admirably for nearly all gaming needs. The
							i5-6500 includes a stock cooler, so 3rd-party cooler isn't necessary. Since we aren't overclocking our CPU, the stock
							cooler will be sufficient in keeping temperatures acceptable.</p>
						<h3>Motherboard</h3>
						<p>Our motherboard is a parametric selection from a sparse set of options. All six of the potential motherboards share
							similar features and will work perfectly for the build. They all have 2 extra DIMM slots for future memory expansion,
							and they all fit the black and white theme of this build.</p>
						<h3>Memory</h3>
						<p>Since memory continues to come down in cost, we can comfortably fit 16GB of DDR4 RAM, which should provide some nice
							memory headroom. We're using a parametric filter to choose a 16GB kit of memory within Intel's recommended specifications
							at the best price, while also filtering for a kit that fits our theme of black and white.</p>
						<h3>Storage</h3>
						<p>We're use parametric filters to incorporate an SSD with at least 480GB of space and a minimum of 2TB 7200RPM mechanical
							storage. Everyone's storage needs differs, so feel free to change those capacities to your heart's desire.</p>
						<h3>GPU</h3>
						<p>For our GPU, the newly released Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 is one of the best price for performance cards on the market
							and an absolute powerhouse. The GTX 1070 will provide a consistent 60fps on many demanding games like Battlefield
							4 (and hopefully the upcoming Battlefield 1) at Ultra at 1080p, and even 1440p for some games like Shadow of Mordor.
							For those interested in VR, the GTX 1070 will have no problem playing any and and all applications currently on the
							market.
						</p>
						<p>We've updated the filter to include a minimum length to avoid "mini" versions of the card, which prioritize fitting
							into small builds, such as an ITX case. You can choose to use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#c=369&amp;qq=1">this filter instead</a>,
							if you want to include the smaller cards for any reason.</p>
						<h3>Case</h3>
						<p>We're rounding out our black and white build with a white Phanteks Eclipse P400S. This is the "silent" version of the
							P400, and it includes sound-dampening foam accordingly. The mid tower P400S features a nice PSU shroud to keep the
							build looking clean. Outside the PSU shroud, we also have plenty of cable managing holes, along with drive mounts
							on the walls of the case. We also have 2 USB 3.0 ports on the front panel.</p>
						<p>The P400S also includes a multicolored LED on the front of the case. You have 8 choices of color, or you can turn it
							off. Additionally, there is an included fan controller for up to two chassis fans.</p>
						<p>Note that this case does not have a 5.25" bay, so traditional optical drives are out. You do <strong>not</strong> need
							an optical drive to install an OS or most software. Downloading and flash drives will take care of the bulk of those.
							If you want an optical drive, you can either purchase an external one, or you can add an internal optical drive to
							your PCPartPicker list, and our compatibility filter will show only cases that can fit it.</p>
						<p>If you'd like to keep with the theme but don't like the white, there's a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/8v38TW/phanteks-case-phec416pswbk">black version</a>							and a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/VyKhP6/phanteks-case-phec416pag">gray version</a>.
							There are also non-windowed options on the site, if you'd prefer that. If you don't want sound-dampening foam, there
							are non-silent editions on the site as well. Cases tend to be highly personal choices, so make sure you browse our
							listed cases to see what suits you.</p>
						<h3>PSU</h3>
						<p>For our power supply, we're using a parametric selection of a five well-reviewed semi or fully modular units, all of
							which are 80+ Bronze certified or above and can provide plenty of power for this build. With the PSU shroud in the
							case, we don't need to worry about the colors of the PSU matching the theme.</p>
